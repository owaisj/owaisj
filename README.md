I'm a software engineer with a passion for learning and building things. I'm currently working at [Edlink](https://ed.link/) as a senior backend engineer. I'm interested in software architecture, distributed systems, and backend engineering.

My favorite languages to use are Python and Rust. I'm also a big fan of [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and [Django REST Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/).
